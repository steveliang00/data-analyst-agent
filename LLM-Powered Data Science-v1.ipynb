For classification tasks, the agent will examine the target column's data type and unique values to determine if it's categorical, then call the classification evaluator, which returns accuracy metrics. For regression tasks involving continuous numerical predictions, the agent will select the regression evaluator that returns the R² score and mean squared error. This decision-making process showcases how a well-designed agent can choose the appropriate tool based on data characteristics, demonstrating intelligent workflow automation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"ace0a431-c475-4c10-8020-64523365f9d8","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Assumes this global cache is shared\nDATAFRAME_CACHE = {}\n\n@tool\ndef evaluate_classification_dataset(file_name: str, target_column: str) -> Dict[str, float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Train and evaluate a classifier on a dataset using the specified target column.\n    Args:\n        file_name (str): The name or path of the dataset stored in DATAFRAME_CACHE.\n        target_column (str): The name of the column to use as the classification target.\n    Returns:\n        Dict[str, float]: A dictionary with the model's accuracy score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Try to get the DataFrame from cache, or load it if not already cached\n    if file_name not in DATAFRAME_CACHE:\n        try:\n            DATAFRAME_CACHE[file_name] = pd.read_csv(file_name)\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            return {\"error\": f\"DataFrame '{file_name}' not found in cache or on disk.\"}\n        except Exception as e:\n            return {\"error\": f\"Error loading '{file_name}': {str(e)}\"}\n    \n    df = DATAFRAME_CACHE[file_name]\n    if target_column not in df.columns:\n        return {\"error\": f\"Target column '{target_column}' not found in '{file_name}'.\"}\n    \n    X = df.drop(columns=[target_column])\n    y = df[target_column]\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n    model = RandomForestClassifier()\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n    return {\"accuracy\": acc}\n\n@tool\ndef evaluate_regression_dataset(file_name: str, target_column: str) -> Dict[str, float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Train and evaluate a regression model on a dataset using the specified target column.\n    Args:\n        file_name (str): The name or path of the dataset stored in DATAFRAME_CACHE.\n        target_column (str): The name of the column to use as the regression target.\n    Returns:\n        Dict[str, float]: A dictionary with R² score and Mean Squared Error.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Try to get the DataFrame from cache, or load it if not already cached\n    if file_name not in DATAFRAME_CACHE:\n        try:\n            DATAFRAME_CACHE[file_name] = pd.read_csv(file_name)\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            return {\"error\": f\"DataFrame '{file_name}' not found in cache or on disk.\"}\n        except Exception as e:\n            return {\"error\": f\"Error loading '{file_name}': {str(e)}\"}\n    \n    df = DATAFRAME_CACHE[file_name]\n    if target_column not in df.columns:\n        return {\"error\": f\"Target column '{target_column}' not found in '{file_name}'.\"}\n    \n    X = df.drop(columns=[target_column])\n    y = df[target_column]\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n    model = RandomForestRegressor()\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n    return {\n        \"r2_score\": r2,\n        \"mean_squared_error\": mse\n    }"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3c9674cb-011a-41bc-a8f6-12147299a829","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Agents\n","\n","Agents in LangChain are advanced components that enable AI models to decide when and how to use tools dynamically.
